# sysad-task2-bharath

well gud evening to all delta folks who somehow took the oppurtunity to read this as you hae seen i have completed my sys-ad task 2 also you might see the task is completly the same from the first task with the including of a dockerfile and a docker.yml file with some additional changes that connects the database or the values to a mysql local host port 3306 although most of these concepts are completely new to me i havent had the chance to fully explore the lamp server and as you can see there is no super mode as that seem somewhat time consuming to me.
